abstract = {Phytoplankton diversity and community composition were studied along the Schelde river-estuary-coastal zone continuum during the summer of 2003. DCA analysis indicated a gradual compositional turnover of the phytoplankton community within the estuary. GAM modelling of species response curves along the estuarine gradient was used to identify taxa that had their population maximum in the river, the coastal zone or within the estuary. Taxa that had their population maximum within the estuary did not form a homogenous community but comprised species with different salinity optima and rather restricted salinity tolerances. The observed changes in community composition along the estuarine transition zone correspond more closely to an ecocline than to an ecotone model. Despite the fact that few taxa had their population maximum at or near the salinity gradient, alpha diversity did not display a minimum around the salinity gradient. This lack of a diversity minimum within the estuary was ascribed to an important contribution of taxa of riverine or coastal origin to alpha diversity within the estuary contributed. On average 55% of the alpha diversity in the estuarine samples was due to riverine or coastal taxa. Beta diversity displayed a clear maximum around the salinity gradient. For planktonic organisms which are subject to mass effects, beta diversity is probably a better indicator for the impact of the salinity gradient on diversity in estuaries than alpha diversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the Schelde continuum, a succession in the phytoplankton community is observed along the transition from the river to the freshwater tidal reaches of the estuary and from the freshwater to brackish reaches of the estuary. The goal of this study was to experimentally evaluate the contribution of changes in salinity and light climate to this succession. In summer 2000 and in spring 2001, phytoplankton communities from the river, the freshwater tidal reaches and the brackish reaches of the estuary were incubated under high or low light intensities and exposed to a change in salinity. HPLC analysis was used to evaluate the response of different algal groups to changes in light intensity and salinity. When incubated at a light intensity corresponding to the mean underwater light intensity of the freshwater tidal reaches, growth of phytoplankton from the river as well as from freshwater tidal reaches was significantly lower than when incubated at a light intensity corresponding to the mean underwater light intensity of the river. The phytoplankton community from the freshwater tidal reaches did not appear to be better adapted to low light intensities than the phytoplankton community from the river. Although diatoms were expected to be less sensitive to a reduction in light intensity than green algae, the opposite response was observed. Freshwater and brackish water phytoplankton were negatively affected by respectively an increase or decrease in salinity. However, the effect of salinity was not strong enough to explain the disappearance of freshwater and brackish water phytoplankton between a salinity of 0.5 and 10 psu, suggesting that other factors also play a role. In the freshwater phytoplankton communities from the river and the freshwater tidal reaches, green algae and diatoms responded in a similar way to an increase in salinity. In the brackish water phytoplankton community, fucoxanthin displayed a different response to salinity than lutein and chlorophyll a. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Natural ecosystems can show regular spatial vegetation patterns, which develop from small-scale ecological interactions. Some studies suggest that grazers can play a major role in controlling vegetation distribution in ecosystems with regular vegetation patterns, but the distribution of grazers and the effects of grazing on vegetation in spatially patterned ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we study how macrofaunal grazers are distributed on a spatially patterned intertidal flat and how they interact with benthic microalgae. The study was carried out on an intertidal flat where each year a regular spatial pattern of diatom-covered hummocks and water-filled hollows develops. In 2 consecutive years, benthic algal biomass was 5-fold lower in the hollows compared with the hummocks, whereas benthic macrofauna was equally abundant on both hummocks and hollows. In the laboratory we evaluated the interactive effect of landscape morphology (hummocks and hollows) and food abundance. Experiments with 2 abundant grazers, Corophium volutator and Hydrobia ulvae showed that food availability was the main driver for the spatial distribution of benthic herbivores rather than landscape morphology. Laboratory experiments, where we analyzed the grazing effects of H. ulvae and C. volutator on benthic algal biomass, revealed that both species increased biomass-specific primary production. This could indicate that benthic grazers can stimulate algal growth, which may explain the high grazer abundances in nearly bare hollows. Increased production of benthic algae may be a key factor uncoupling herbivore density from benthic algal biomass on a spatially patterned intertidal flat. {\textcopyright} 2011 Inter-Research.},

@article{Colen2009,
abstract = {To assess the role of macrofauna-mediated sediment changes on nematode community recovery, we examined the temporal development of macrobenthos, nematode communities and sediment properties following hypoxia in 16 m 2 replicated plots over a 6 mo period. Hypoxia drastically changed nematode community composition (i.e. reduced diversity and abundances of all dominant nematodes, except Odontophora spp.), but complete mortality, as was the case for the macrobenthos, did not occur. Macrofauna diversity recovered slowly, but community composition approached that of control communities after several months. In contrast, nematode diversity recovered to control values within 1 mo but, subsequently, decreased again; hence, no clear convergence towards the control community composition was apparent. This diversity decline and lack of community recovery was mainly attributed to abundance overshoots of the epistrate feeding nematodes Chromadora spp., Daptonema spp. and Ptycholaimellus ponticus in the treatments, which dominated the treatment community after 2 mo. Nematode community reassembling was strongly related to the coupled macrobenthos-environmental temporal development. The dynamics of 2 sediment characteristics, which were both mediated by the colonizing macrobenthos, are presented as possible determinant factors for this relationship: (1) low nematode post-settlement resuspension resulting from stable sediments at early macrofauna recovery stages and (2) enhanced nematode reproduction and settlement success in a dense microphytobenthos mat in relation to the temporal variation in macrobenthos grazing pressure and bioturbation. In conclusion, the strong relationships between macrobenthos recovery, environmental development and nematode community development after hypoxia highlight the importance of macrobenthos-sediment interactions in the recovery and structuring of nematode communities. {\textcopyright} 2009 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {During the course of 1996, the brackish to freshwater tidal reaches of the Schelde Estuary were sampled monthly along a longitudinal transect to study the origin and composition of phytoplankton communities in the freshwater tidal estuary. Variation in the phytoplankton community as a whole and its relation with the abiotic environment was analysed using multivariate analysis with variation partitioning. Of the variation in the species data 23{\textperiodcentered}4% was spatially structured and a large part (13{\textperiodcentered}8%) was explained by salinity or factors co-varying with salinity, with a marked species succession observed along the salinity gradient. Spatial variation not related to salinity (9{\textperiodcentered}6%) was mainly situated within the freshwater tidal reaches, where in the uppermost stations phytoplankton was imported from the riverine tributaries while in the more downstream situated stations it was produced in situ. Riverine phytoplankton declined after import into the estuary where it was replaced by autochthonous, estuarine populations which were adapted to the low light climate and/or resistant to rotifer grazing. Of the species variation 27{\textperiodcentered}8% was temporally structured. While riverine blooms appeared to be initiated by an increase in irradiance a decrease in river discharge in spring, estuarine phytoplankton only developed in summer, when temperature increased. Some potentials and limitations of the use of multivariate analyses with variation partitioning in pelagic estuarine environments are discussed in view of our results. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Men's interest in the contraceptive and reproductive spheres is often considered to be minimal, with management of these domains traditionally constructed as ``feminine.'' Despite this, some men, who have no interest in having children, choose to take a higher degree of control over their reproductive bodies, voluntarily seeking a ``preemptive'' vasectomy. This article reports on interview data with twelve men who had preemptive vasectomies, describing the shared meaning making (and subject positions) many of these men took up in relation to the operation. The subject positions can be identified by (1) descriptions of themselves and/or their lifestyles as ``selfish,'' and (2) descriptions of themselves and/or their lifestyles as ``unconventional.'' While these self-descriptors might be construed negatively, an indication of marginalization, the authors would argue that the men were able to put a positive spin on these features using neoliberal discourses of choice and personal responsibility. Access to such discourses might be seen as an indication of the men's privileged rather than marginalized status, allowing them to make such a decision ``easier'' than it might be for many women. The authors would also suggest that having a preemptive vasectomy might be seen as a rejection of contemporary modes of involved fatherhood.},

abstract = {We assessed the influence of benthic communities on sediment properties in large defaunation experiments in replicated 16 m2 plots on a tidal flat in the Westerschelde estuary (SW Netherlands). We compared microphytobenthos and benthic macrofauna recovery and recolonisation between control and defaunated sediments during 8 mo following the defaunation, focussing on how the temporal scale of biological responses interact with the temporal scale of sedimentolog- ical developments (grain size, bed level, erosion threshold). In the first month, microphytobenthos (surface chl a content) increased to > 3 times the control values and remained elevated until 3 mo after the start of the experiment. Macrofaunal recovery started with mobile mudsnails after only a few days. Tube-building macrofauna dominated first, followed by surface-disrupting species. Both groups became much more dominant in defaunated than in control plots. Surface pelletisers almost recovered to control levels after 4 mo, while biodiffusing bivalves did not recover during the course of the experiment. Mud content of the sediment surface first increased with chl a, but started to decrease, concomitant with an over-representation of surface disruptors. A similar trend was observed for critical erosion threshold. Bed elevation of experimental plots exceeded controls by several cm after 1 mo, and remained higher through summer. The time scales of changes in micro-phytobenthos and in abiotic characteristics of the sediment were largely set by the time scale of macrofauna recovery. Macrobenthos plays a critical, but complex role in the dynamics of intertidal sediments. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {A mud transport model for the Scheldt estuary is being developed. Its purpose is to support managers of the Scheldt estuary with the solutionofa numberof managerial issues. The model domain ranges from the tidal boundary at Gent down to the Belgian coastal cities of Nieuwpoort and Zeebrugge. The hydrodynamic simulations on which the mud transport model is based show realistic values for water levels, salinities and residual currents in the major part of the model domain. However, the propagation of the tidal wave is modelled less accurately upstream of Antwerp. Regardingthemud transport simulations, which are based onsimple process formulations, it isshown that a satisfactory agreement is obtained between computed and observed concentration levels and their spatial and temporal variations. SPM levels in the Scheldt appear to be rather sensitive to the volume of harbour siltation and dumping, notably near Antwerp. The sediment budget computed by the model includes an unrealistically high residual sediment flux towards the North Sea. By enhancing the estuarine mud circulation, the modelled residual flux becomes smaller and agrees better with observation-based estimates. A longer hydrodynamic simulation period (presently up to 3 months) would help to analyse the sediment budget and seasonal dynamics in more detail. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This chapter looks at a data set where our first reaction was: `How in heavens name are we going to analyse these data?' The data consist of a large number of phytoplankton species measured at 31 stations in Dutch estuarine and marine waters. Measurements took place 0--4 times per month from 1990 until present (2005). Environmental data (e.g. temperature, salinity, etc.) were also measured, albeit sometimes at different sampling times! The statistical analysis of these data is complicated for several reasons:1.Environmental variables and phytoplankton variables were not always measured at the same time.2.There may be temporal correlation, there may be spatial correlation, and both correlation structures may be complicated.3.The data contain a large number of species.4.The data are irregularly spaced.5.There may be heterogeneity over time (e.g. more variation in summer than in winter).6.Trends over time and in space may be non-linear.7.The phytoplankton data were counted by different laboratories.},

Four policy qustions were at the heart of the project: (1) what are the ecological impacts of shellfish fishery?, (2) did the policies implemented in 1993 achieve their objectives, (3) is current shellfish fishery in line with international obligations, (4) what possiblities for improvement do exist? These policy questions were translated into research questions. Numbers of large shellfish-eating birds declined. Some restoration of seagrass beds occurred, but restoration was not maximal. The area of littoral mussel beds in the Wadden Sea increased to more than 2000 ha, after having disappeared completely in 1990.},

@article{Schneider2020,
abstract = {While traditional microplankton community assessments focus primarily on phytoplankton and protozooplankton, the last decade has witnessed a growing recognition of photo-phago mixotrophy (performed by mixoplankton) as an important nutritional route among plankton. However, the trophic classification of plankton and subsequent analysis of the trophic composition of plankton communities is often subjected to the historical dichotomy. We circumvented this historical dichotomy by employing a 24 year-long time series on abiotic and protist data to explore the trophic composition of protist communities in the Southern North Sea. In total, we studied three different classifications. Classification A employed our current knowledge by labeling only taxa documented to be mixoplankton as such. In a first trophic proposal (classification B), documented mixoplankton and all phototrophic taxa (except for diatoms, cyanobacteria, and colonial Phaeocystis) were classified as mixoplankton. In a second trophic proposal (classification C), documented mixoplankton as well as motile, phototrophic taxa associated in a principle component analysis with documented mixoplankton were classified as mixoplankton. In all three classifications, mixoplankton occurred most in the inorganic nutrient-depleted, seasonally stratified environments. While classification A was still subjected to the traditional dichotomy and underestimated the amount of mixoplankton, our results indicate that classification B overestimated the amount of mixoplankton. Classification C combined knowledge gained from the other two classifications and resulted in a plausible trophic composition of the protist community. Using results of classification C, our study provides a list of potential unrecognized mixoplankton in the Southern North Sea. Furthermore, our study suggests that low turbidity and the maturity of an ecosystem, quantified using a newly proposed index of ecosystem maturity (ratio of organic to total nitrogen), provide an indication on the relevance of mixoplankton in marine protist communities.},

abstract = {The ecological importance of mixoplankton within marine protist communities is slowly being recognized. However, most aquatic ecosystem models do not include formulations to model a complete protist community consisting of phytoplankton, protozooplankton and mixoplankton. We introduce PROTIST, a new module for the aquatic ecosystem modelling software Delft3D-WAQ that can model a protist community consisting of two types of phytoplankton (diatoms and green algae), two types of mixoplankton (constitutive mixoplankton and non-constitutive mixoplankton) and protozooplankton. We employed PROTIST to further explore the hypothesis that the biogeochemical gradient of inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations drives the observed occurrence of constitutive mixoplankton in the Dutch Southern North Sea. To explore this hypothesis, we used 11 1D-vertical aquatic ecosystem models that mimic the abiotic conditions of 11 routine monitoring locations in the Dutch Southern North Sea. Our models result in plausible trophic compositions across the biogeochemical gradient as compared to in-situ data. A sensitivity analysis showed that the dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica concentrations drive the occurrence of constitutive mixoplankton in the Dutch Southern North Sea.},

De samenhang in het waterbeleid waarop het NWP inzet, geldt ten volle ook voor het beheer en gebruik van de Noordzee. Diverse ontwikkelingen op en rond de Noordzee vertonen een vaste trend naar toenemende intensivering van het gebruik. Tegelijkertijd zijn nationaal en internatio- naal duidelijke randvoorwaarden gesteld om het ecosysteem van de Noordzee te kunnen herstellen en beschermen. De integraliteit in het waterbeheer, die het NWP voorstaat, is voor het Noordzeebeleid in de komende decennia dan ook niet een keuze uit verschillende opties, maar een harde noodzaak. De opgave voor de komende jaren is het vinden van de juiste maatschap- pelijke balans om te kunnen komen tot een efci{\"{e}}nte en veilige ruimtelijke ontwikkeling van de Noordzee die past binnen de randvoorwaarden van een gezond ecosysteem. Met het Programma Noordzee 2022-2027 stelt het Rijk de kaders voor ruimtelijk gebruik van de Noordzee in relatie tot de toestand van het mariene ecosysteem, en voor het beleid gericht op het verbeteren van de milieutoestand.

abstract = {Quantifying spatial variability in intertidal benthic productivity is necessary to guide management of estuaries and to understand estuarine ecological processes, including the amount of benthic organic carbon available for grazing, burial and transport to the pelagic zone. We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m−2 h−1) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, $\chi$ = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = −17.6, $\chi$ = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing-based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest. Model calibration, results and possible applications for regular monitoring of MPB production are discussed below.},

abstract = {The residence time of the water masses in the Westerschelde estuary was determined using a simple compartment-model that simulates the advective-diffusive transport of a conservative dissolved substance (chlorinity). The residence time of a water parcel in the upstream part of the estuary (i.e. the time needed for this water parcel to leave the estuary) varied from about 50 days in winter to about 70 days in summer. The most seaward compartment had residence times of about 10-15 days. Dispersive coefficients that are fixed in time were able to reproduce the observed salinity distributions very well in the Westerschelde. They were obtained by calibration on observed chlorinities. It is argued that the apparent relationship of dispersive coefficients with freshwater flow, which is observed in certain studies, could (partly) reflect the deviation from steady state conditions which are required assumptions to calculate these dispersive coefficients directly from salinity profiles. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional, nested grid, hydrodynamic, and reactive-transport model of the macrotidal Scheldt estuary (B/NL) and its tributaries has been developed to identify the driving forces controlling the temporal and spatial dynamics of primary production during a summer diatom bloom. The hydrodynamic model indicates that energy dissipation reaches its maximum 90 km upstream from the mouth, closely followed by a minimum farther upstream. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics is simulated to provide the transient light conditions in the water column. Results show that the spatial distribution of SPM mirrors closely the profile of energy dissipation. The temporal SPM dynamics is highly sensitive to fluctuations in river discharge, whose influence decreases downstream. Peaks in SPM are triggered by high discharges and can be recorded as far as 50 km seaward of the upstream model boundary. Results from the phytoplankton model demonstrate the fast response of diatom growth to changes in the physical environment, especially those due to daily variations in river discharge which continuously modify the SPM concentrations and residence times. Episodes of persistent low flow conditions lead to a progressive depletion of dissolved silica. Simulated diatom growth becomes increasingly controlled by silica availability, until primary production collapses. The spatiotemporal evolution of primary production is explored over the entire domain of forcing conditions. The distribution of the daily maximum of net primary production and its location reveal that four different system states can be identified in the forcing planes. The transition from one state to the other characterizes the diatom growth response in the estuary. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

This has resulted in enhanced growth of phytoplankton, shifts in composition of the plankton community and changes in the structure of ecosystems, which are often considered to be objectionable. To help understanding these processes and to predict future conditions, a mathematical model, BLOOM, has been developed and applied since 1977.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s). Many protist plankton are mixotrophs, combining phototrophy and phagotrophy. Their role in freshwater and marine ecology has emerged as a major developing feature of plankton research over recent decades. To better aid discussions, we suggest these organisms are termed "mixoplankton", as "planktonic protist organisms that express, or have potential to express, phototrophy and phagotrophy". The term "phytoplankton" then describes phototrophic organisms incapable of phagotrophy. "Protozooplankton" describes phagotrophic protists that do not engage in acquired phototrophy. The complexity of the changes to the conceptual base of the plankton trophic web caused by inclusion of mixoplanktonic activities are such that we suggest that the restructured description is termed the "mixoplankton paradigm". Implications and opportunities for revision of survey and fieldwork, of laboratory experiments and of simulation modelling are considered. The main challenges are not only with taxonomic and functional identifications, and with measuring rates of potentially competing processes within single cells, but with decades of inertia built around the traditional paradigm that assumes a separation of trophic processes between different organisms. In keeping with the synergistic nature of cooperative photo- and phagotrophy in mixoplankton, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach will be required to tackle the task ahead.},

abstract = {Marine waters can be highly heterogeneous both on a spatial and temporal scale, yet monitoring programs currently rely primarily on low-resolution methods. This potentially leads to undersampling. This study explores the potential of two high-resolution methods for monitoring phytoplankton dynamics: fast repetition rate fluorometry for information on phytoplankton photosynthesis and productivity and automated scanning flow cytometry for information on phytoplankton abundance and community composition. These methods were tested in combination with an underway Ferrybox system during four cruises on the Dutch North Sea in April, May, June, and August 2017. The high-resolution methods were able to visualize both the spatial and temporal variability of the phytoplankton community in the Dutch North Sea. Spectral cluster analysis was applied to objectively interpret the multitude of parameters and visualize potential spatial patterns. This resulted in the identification of biogeographic regions with distinct phytoplankton communities, which varied per cruise. Our results clearly show that the sampling based on fixed stations does not give a good representation of the spatial patterns, showing the added value of underway high-resolution measurements. To fully exploit the potential of the tested high-resolution measurement setup, methodological constraints need further research. Among these constraints are accounting for the diurnal cycle in photophysiological parameters concurrent to the spatial variation, better predictions of the electron requirement for carbon fixation to estimate gross primary productivity, and the identification of more flow cytometer clusters with informative value. Nevertheless, the richness of additional information provided by high-resolution methods can improve existing low-resolution monitoring programs towards a more precise and ecosystemic ecological assessment of the phytoplankton community and productivity.},

abstract = {The set-up, application and validation of a generic ecological model (GEM) for estuaries and coastal waters is presented. This model is a comprehensive ecological model of the bottom of the foodweb, consisting of a set of modules, representing specific water quality processes and primary production that can be combined with any transport model to create a dedicated model for a specific ecosystem. GEM links different physical, chemical and ecological model components into one generic and flexible modelling tool that allows for variable sized, curvilinear grids to accomodate both the requirements for local accuracy while maintaining a relatively short model run-time. The GEM model describes the behaviour of nutrients, organic matter and primary producers in estuaries and coastal waters, incorporating dynamic process modules for dissolved oxygen, nutrients and phytoplankton. GEM integrates the best aspects of existing Dutch estuarine models that were mostly dedicated to only one type of ecosystem, geographic area or subset of processes. Particular strengths of GEM include its generic applicability and the integration and interaction of biological, chemical and physical processes into one predictive tool. The model offers flexibility in choosing which processes to include, and the ability to integrate results from different processes modelled simultaneously with different temporal resolutions. The generic applicability of the model is illustrated using a number of representative examples from case studies in which the GEM model was successfully applied. Validation of these examples was carried out using the 'cost function' to compare model results with field observations. The validation results demonstrated consistent accuracy of the GEM model for various key parameters in both spatial dimensions (horizontally and vertically) as well as temporal dimensions (seasonally and across years) for a variety of water systems without the need for major reparameterisation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The prototype is designed to quantify pressures of human activities in the marine environment and translate those pressures to (potential) effects on ecosystem indicators. The prototype was developed for the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) in order to assess its potential use in strategic management decisions. The implemented prototype scales impacts from human activities to population relevant indicators, although actual population size and distribution are not determined. Focus for future work should be on expansion of the list of included human activities and pressures and not so much to attempt to incorporate population dynamics. The strength of the approach is in the transparency, it can be relatively easily understood. It combines spatial data to get insight in effects on survival and reproduction. The simplicity makes adjustments and extensions uncomplicated. The visual aspects combined with the speed of the calculations makes it a powerful tool to support discussions with experts, and it can guide or focus future research.},

abstract = {Active deepening of tidal channels usually results in the alteration of the vertical and the horizontal tide. This may lead to concurrent significant increases in mean suspended matter concentrations (SPM) in coastal plain estuaries, the turbidity maximum (ETM) included. This is exemplified by an extensive analysis of the Ems estuary, a prototypical heavily stressed estuary in the Dutch-German border area. Measurements show that the SPM concentrations in the lower reaches of the estuary have increased an average of 2- to 3-fold between 1954 and 2005, with a 10-fold increase observed in the upper estuary (tidal river). Longitudinal profiles of surface SPM demonstrate that the ETM has moved upstream by up to 25km and has broadened into a zone 30km in length which extends into the freshwater tidal river. On an annual scale, variations in freshwater discharge significantly influence the formation and breakdown of the ETM: during low river discharge the ETM approaches equilibrium over 2-3 months, whilst elevated river discharges relocate the ETM downstream over several weeks.An exploratory, semi-analytical model is calibrated to simulate the equilibrium SPM distribution in the upper estuary during five time periods from 1965 to 2005, using archival bathymetric and tidal data. Results suggest that the deepening of tidal channels and a reduction in hydraulic drag have most likely resulted in a landward shift of the SPM trapping location. The measured increase in SPM concentrations and the development of fluid mud around the 1990s likely contributed to reduced mixing and bottom drag, creating a feedback loop that further altered tidal and SPM dynamics. It is argued that the removal of some non-erodible (consolidated) layers in the lower reaches of the estuary has created new internal sediment sources that may be responsible for feeding the observed high SPM concentrations, rather than increased sediment input from the boundaries. All findings are based on and supported by measured short-term seasonal fluctuations, as well as long-term developments of yearly averaged concentrations in the longitudinal SPM distribution. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The autotrophic production and heterotrophic consumption of organic matter in the Westerschelde, a highly turbid and eutrophic estuary in the Southwest Netherlands is examined by means of a dynamic simulation model. The model describes the ecologically relevant processes in thirteen spatial compartments and adequately fits most observed data. Three autotrophic processes are included in the model. Net pelagic photosynthetic production is relatively low (average 41. gC m(-2) yr(-1)) and three spatial compartments near the turbidity maximum zone are respiratory sinks of phytoplankton biomass. According to the model, net phytobenthic primary production is more important than pelagic primary production in the upstream half of the Westerschelde. On the scale of the entire estuary, benthic primary production amounts to about 60% of pelagic primary production. Water-column nitrification, which is very important in the nitrogen cycle, is most pronounced near the turbidity zone where it accounts for the major autotrophic fixation of carbon (up to 27 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Viewed on the scale of the total estuary, however, the process is not very important. Less than 20% of total organic carbon input to the estuary is primary produced, the remainder is imported from waste discharges and from the river. The degree of heterotrophy of the Westerschelde estuary proved to be one of the highest yet reported. On average 380 g carbon per square metre is net lost per year (range 200-1200 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The yearly community respiration (bacterial mineralization, respiration of higher trophic levels and sedimentation) is 4 to 35 times (estuarine mean of 6) higher than the net production. This degree of heterotrophy is highest near the turbidity maximum and generally decreases from the freshwater to the seaward boundary. About 75% of all carbon losses can be ascribed to pelagic heterotrophic processes; the sediment is only locally important. Mineralisation rates are highest in the turbidity region, but as only a fraction of total carbon resides here, less than 20% of all organic carbon is lost in this part of the estuary. This result is in contradiction with a previous budget of the estuary, based on data of the early seventies, where more than 80% of all carbon was estimated to be lost in the turbidity zone. Part of this discrepancy is probably caused by changes that have occurred in the estuary since that time. Due to the high heterotrophic activity, nearly all imported and in situ produced carbon is lost in the estuary itself and the Westerschelde is an insignificant source of organic matter to the coastal zone. The model estuary acts as a trap for reactive organic matter, both from the land, from the sea or in situ produced. Internal cycling, mainly in the water column, results in the removal of most of the carbon while the more refractory part is exported to the sea.},

abstract = {The Benthic Ecosystem Quality Index 2 (BEQI2) is the Dutch multi-metric index (MMI) for assessing the status and trend of benthic invertebrates in transitional and coastal waters for the Water Framework Directive (WFD). It contains the same indicators, i.e. species richness, Shannon index and AMBI, as in the multivariate m-AMBI. The latter MMI has been adopted by several European countries in the context of WFD implementation. In contrast to m-AMBI, the BEQI2 calculation procedure has been strongly simplified and consists of two steps, i.e. the separate indicator values are normalized using their long-term reference values resulting in three Ecological Quality Ratios (EQRs), which are subsequently averaged to give one BEQI2 value. Using this method only small numbers of samples need to be analysed by Dutch benthos laboratories annually, without the necessity to co-analyse a larger historical dataset. BEQI2 EQR values appeared to correlate quantitatively very well with m-AMBI EQR values. In addition, a data pooling procedure has been added to the BEQI2 tool which enables the pooling of small core samples (0.01-0.025m<sup>2</sup>) into larger standardized data pools of 0.1m<sup>2</sup> in order to meet the data requirements of the AMBI indicator and to obtain comparable reference values. Furthermore, the BEQI2 tool automatically and efficiently converts species synonym names into standardized species names. The BEQI2 tool has been applied to all Dutch benthos data monitored by Rijkswaterstaat in the period of 1991-2010 in the transitional and coastal waters and salt lakes and these results are reported here for the first time. Reference values for species richness and Shannon index (99 percentile values) and AMBI reference values (1 percentile values) were estimated for all water body-ecotopes and are discussed. BEQI2 results for all these water bodies are discussed in view of natural and human pressures. The pressure sensitivity of the BEQI2 for sewage and dredging/dumping, via the state variables oxygen and suspended matter respectively, was demonstrated.},

abstract = {The expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ's) in estuaries can be harmful for ecology and economy, prompting the demand for expensive measures. Here we look at the oxygen dynamics in two northern temperate European estuaries, the Schelde (The Netherlands/Belgium) and the Elbe (Germany) and analysed data from the period of 2004–2009. The Schelde is characterized by two zones of increased oxygen consumption; the Elbe shows one zone of increased oxygen consumption. Despite reduction in biochemical oxygen demand in both estuaries, oxygen conditions improved in the Schelde estuary, while the oxygen minimum zone persisted in the Elbe estuary. To understand these different oxygen dynamics, we applied a one-dimensional reactive transport model to both estuaries. In the Schelde we found low oxygen concentrations to be related to organic matter and ammonium input from the major tributaries. In the Elbe, additionally to a high input of organic matter from upstream, oxygen dynamics were influenced by abrupt changes in estuarine morphology. Next, the origin of the organic matter substrate differs between the two estuaries. In the Elbe, the organic matter imported is mostly composed of algal die-off produced in the Elbe River upstream. In the Schelde the organic matter and ammonium input is mostly related to sewage input of anthropogenic origin. This implies that waste water treatment will be more effective to remediate hypoxia related problems in the Schelde than in the Elbe.},

abstract = {The Southern Bight of the North Sea is a shallow shelf sea, strongly influenced by river-borne nutrient loads. Eutrophication symptoms manifest themselves as high levels of chlorophyll-a and long-lasting, extensive blooms of Phaeocystis globosa, especially in the waters along the continental coast. As a consequence of measures to reduce eutrophication, riverine phosphorus loads have decreased more than 50% in the last two decades, and nitrogen loads show a decrease of ca 30%. While decreases in riverine N and P loads are observed, an increase in summer river-borne loads of silica occurred. Since 1990, The Netherlands has carried out a routine monitoring program in the North Sea, including analysis of phytoplankton composition and carbon biomass. An analysis of these data for the period 1990-2007 shows a trend in phytoplankton composition, toward an increase in diatom biomass, increased bloom frequency and maximum bloom cell numbers of several diatom species, in particular Chaeotoceros socialis, in the coastal waters. These changes coincide with increases in riverine Si loadings and increased Si concentrations in coastal waters as a consequence of changed river loads. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@techreport{Craeymeersch2007,
abstract = {Sinds het ontstaan van het Veerse Meer in 1961 is de kwaliteit van het water en het ecosysteem steeds verder achteruitgegaan. De belangrijkste problemen waren de toevoer van zoet (te) voedselrijk polderwater, sterk wisselende zoutgehalten door het inlaten van zout water in het voorjaar t.b.v. het peilbeheer en gelaagdheid van het water als gevolg van het peilbeheer, het zwaardere zoute water 'kroop' onder het zoete water. De opwarming van de zoetere bovenlaag in de zomer versterkte de gelaagdheid. Deze (combinatie) van factoren leidde tot overmatige algenbloeien, waardoor het water troebeler werd; zuurstofloosheid van grote oppervlakten op en bij de bodem van het meer en massale aanwezigheid van Zeesla, die overlast voor de recreanten tot gevolg had en die later in het seizoen door afsterven leidde tot stankoverlast. Troebelheid, wisselende zoutgehalten, hoge concentratie nutri%nten (voedselrijk) en zuurstofloos van het water leidden ertoe, dat in het Veerse Meer de soortendiversiteit van planten en dieren erg gering was. In de Milieu Effect Rapportage van 1989 is waterverversing naar voren gekomen als een manier om de waterkwaliteitsproblemen op te lossen. Zowel modelstudies als expert judgement ondersteunden in een later stadium de keus voor de aanleg van een doorlaatmiddel. Dit mondt uiteindelijk in 2004 uit in de opening van de Katse Heule, een doorlaatmiddel in de Zandkreekdam dat de uitwisseling van water tussen de Oosterschelde en het Veerse Meer mogelijk maakt. In de zomer wordt per tij gemiddeld zowel 40 m3/s in- als uitgelaten. In verband met het peilbeheer loopt dat in de winter terug tot 23 m3/s. Sinds de ingebruikname van het doorlaatmiddel in juni 2004 zijn de veranderingen in het Veerse Meer nauwkeurig gevolgd. Dit rapport geeft een tussenevaluatie op basis van de gegevens tot eind 2006. Een volledige evaluatie kan pas worden uitgevoerd als het Veerse Meer weer helemaal in evenwicht is. Het doorlaatmiddel is een succes. Een groter succes zelfs dan berekend is en verwacht werd. De toevoer van het polderwater is hetzelfde gebleven, maar het voedselrijke water wordt nu sneller afgevoerd naar de Oosterschelde. Het fosfaatgehalte is bijvoorbeeld met een factor 2 afgenomen in de winter en in de zomer zelfs met een factor 5. Het stikstofgehalte daalde met 30%. Het zoutgehalte van het Veerse Meer ligt het hele jaar door maar iets lager dan het zoutgehalte van de Oosterschelde en de gelaagdheid als gevolg van de inlaat van zout water is verdwenen. Wel was sprake van temperatuurstratificatie, maar de zuurstofloosheid bleef beperkt tot korte (warme) periodes en in de diepe putten. Er is geen overmatige bloei van Zeesla geweest, maar de kans daarop blijft wel aanwezig, omdat de stikstofconcentratie in het voorjaar hoog blijft. Het gemiddelde doorzicht nam weliswaar toe, maar niet zoveel als voorspeld. Dit is vooral te wijten aan het lage doorzicht (1m) in de warme zomermaanden van 2006. Het aantal soorten dieren en planten in het Veerse Meer is sinds de ingebruikname van de Katse Heule duidelijk toegenomen. Er is (nog) geen afname van brakke bodemdiersoorten waargenomen en het aantal soorten zoutwaterbodemdieren is vooral in het oosten flink toegenomen (o.a. soorten krabben, garnalen), ook de mossel is terug in het Veerse Meer. De gegevens over vissen zijn nog niet gerapporteerd, maar het is wel duidelijk dat er na 2004 meer soorten zijn aangetroffen, bijvoorbeeld de Zeebaars, Ansjovis en de trekvis de Fint. De verbetering van het doorzicht en herstel van de vissoorten lijkt al tot een herstel van de visetende vogels hebben geleid. Ook de andere vogelsoorten lijken te profiteren van de herstellende waterkwaliteit. In dit rapport wordt ook vastgesteld dat met het huidige peilbeheer de oeverzone tussen NAP -0,1m en NAP -0,6m (ca 15% van het totale oppervlak) in de winterperiode droogvalt. De bodemorganismen in deze zone sterven jaarlijks grotendeels af als gevolg van uitdroging, predatie en vorst. Ook de kansen voor de terugkeer van zeegras zijn klein door het peilverschil tussen de zomer en winter. In 2005 startte een planstudie (MER) en op basis daarvan is ondertussen een concept peilbesluit genomen: het huidige zomerpeil blijft gehandhaafd en het winterpeil wordt verhoogd van NAP-0,60 m naar NAP -0,30 m om de ecologie en de waterkwaliteit van het meer nog verder te verbeteren. De lozing van polderwater op het meer zal verder gereduceerd worden door de vervanging van Gemaal Oostwatering door Gemaal Poppekinderen, dat gaat lozen op het Kanaal door Walcheren. De in dit rapport beschreven veranderingen in nutri%ntengehalten, doorzicht en algengroei na de ingebruikname van de Katse Heule zijn zo positief voor de waterkwaliteit, dat een verder vervolg van de afleiding van polderwater minder noodzakelijk lijkt. De volgende evaluatie, waar ook de resultaten van de nieuwe afwateringssituatie duidelijk zullen zijn, zal hier aandacht aan besteden},

abstract = {Recent observations and modelling studies suggest that biogeochemical changes can mask atmospheric CO2-induced pH decreases. Data collected by the Dutch monitoring authorities in different coastal systems (North Sea, Wadden Sea, Ems-Dollard, Eastern Scheldt and Scheldt estuary) since 1975 provide an excellent opportunity to test whether this is the case in the Dutch coastal zone. The time-series were analysed using Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) which resulted in the identification of system-dependent patterns on both seasonal and intra-annual time scales. The observed rates of pH change greatly exceed those expected from enhanced CO2 uptake, thus suggesting that other biogeochemical processes, possibly related to changes in nutrient loading, can play a dominant role in ocean acidification. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of the coastal zone is now a well-established fact. However, there is still uncertainty about the mechanisms through which nutrient enrichment can disrupt biological communities and ecosystem processes in the coastal zone. For example, while some estuaries exhibit classic symptoms of acute eutrophication, including enhanced production of algal biomass, other nutrient-rich estuaries maintain low algal biomass and primary production. This implies that large differences exist among coastal ecosystems in the rates and patterns of nutrient assimilation and cycling. Part of this variability comes from differences among ecosystems in the other resource that can limit algal growth and production - the light energy required for photosynthesis. Complete understanding of the eutrophication process requires consideration of the interacting effects of light and nutrients, including the role of light availability as a regulator of the expression of eutrophication. A simple index of the relative strength of light and nutrient limitation of algal growth can be derived from models that describe growth rate as a function of these resources. This index can then be used as one diagnostic to classify the sensitivity of coastal ecosystems to the harmful effects of eutrophication. Here I illustrate the application of this diagnostic with light and nutrient measurements made in three California estuaries and two Dutch estuaries.},

abstract = {In the Dutch coastal zone, nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations show gradients of up to one order of magnitude perpendicular to the coast within the first 30-50 km offshore. Time-series analysis reveals significant decreasing trends for dissolved inorganic phosphorus (40%) and total phosphorus (35%) and an increase in the dissolved inorganic N:P ratio from 25-30 to 40-55 over the period 1988-1995. Trends in nitrogen (- 15%), silicate (stable), and chlorophyll are smaller and generally not statistically significant. The trends in phosphorus reflect a proportional and immediate response to decreasing riverine inputs. The observed trends, spatial gradients, and long-term seasonal patterns are simulated quite well with a coupled physical-ecological model with high spatial resolution for the coastal zone. The model results indicate no effect of decreasing phosphorus, but an important role for both nitrogen and light climate in primary production and algal biomass. These results have been reproduced in mesocosm experiments. Moreover, these experiments indicate a strong response of primary production and chlorophyll to nitrogen load, whereas secondary production (macrobenthos) remains relatively stable. Ecological efficiency of secondary production increases from 7% to > 10%, with a decrease in nitrogen loading by 50% from the present level. In the absence of a significant nitrogen reduction in coastal waters, the mesocosm results cannot be related to field data as yet. However, the expectation is that reducing nitrogen inputs will not affect productivity at higher trophic levels to any great extent.},

abstract = {An extensive survey was carried out in the Westerschelde estuary in 1989 to estimate phytoplankton primary productivity. High nutrient concentrations year round and very high turbidity resulted in light-limited growth of phytoplankton. This was reflected in a conservative behaviour of silicate and phosphate. The same was true for total inorganic nitrogen. However, in the inner part of the estuary nitrification took place. The calculated annual primary production was 200 - 300 gC{\textperiodcentered}m-2 at the range 29-20 salinity, 100-150 gC{\textperiodcentered}m-2 at 18-10 salinity and increased sharply to 900 gC{\textperiodcentered}m-2 at 2.5 salinity due to freshwater populations. In the inner part of the estuary the vertical mixing zone was frequently larger than 5 times the euphotic zone. The high rates of primary production we measured contrast with generally expected values. This corroborates Grobbelaar's hypothesis that the critical depth can be seriously underestimated. Phytoplankton copes with the turbid conditions by adjusting light-utilization efficiencies. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Cloern2001,
abstract = {A primary focus of coastal science during the past 3 decades has been the question: How does anthropogenic nutrient enrichment cause change in the structure or function of nearshore coastal ecosystems? This theme of environmental science is recent, so our conceptual model of the coastal eutrophication problem continues to change rapidly. In this review, I suggest that the early (Phase I) conceptual model was strongly influenced by limnologists, who began intense study of lake eutrophication by the 1960s. The Phase I model emphasized changing nutrient input as a signal, and responses to that signal as increased phytoplankton biomass and primary production, decomposition of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, and enhanced depletion of oxygen from bottom waters. Coastal research in recent decades has identified key differences in the responses of lakes and coastal-estuarine ecosystems to nutrient enrichment. The contemporary (Phase II) conceptual model reflects those differences and includes explicit recognition of (1) system-specific attributes that act as a filter to modulate the responses to enrichment (leading to large differences among estuarine-coastal systems in their sensitivity to nutrient enrichment); and (2) a complex suite of direct and indirect responses including linked changes in: water transparency, distribution of vascular plants and biomass of macroalgae, sediment biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling, nutrient ratios and their regulation of phytoplankton community composition, frequency of toxic/harmful algal blooms, habitat quality for metazoans, reproduction/growth/survival of pelagic and benthic invertebrates, and subtle changes such as shifts in the seasonality of ecosystem functions. Each aspect of the Phase II model is illustrated here with examples from coastal ecosystems around the world. In the last section of this review I present one vision of the next (Phase III) stage in the evolution of our conceptual model, organized around 5 questions that will guide coastal science in the early 21st century: (1) How do system-specific attributes constrain or amplify the responses of coastal ecosystems to nutrient enrichment? (2) How does nutrient enrichment interact with other stressors (toxic contaminants, fishing harvest, aquaculture, nonindigenous species; habitat loss, climate change, hydrologic manipulations) to change coastal ecosystems? (3) How are responses to multiple stressors linked? (4) How does human-induced change in the coastal zone impact the Earth system as habitat for humanity and other species? (5) How can a deeper scientific understanding of the coastal eutrophication problem be applied to develop tools for building strategies at ecosystem restoration or rehabilitation?},

abstract = {Abiotic factors and primary production by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos was studied in the turbid Westeschelde estuary. Because of the high turbidity and high nutrient concentrations primary production by phytoplankton is light-limited. In the inner and central parts of the estuary maximum rates of primary production were therefore measured during the summer, whereas in the more marine part spring and autumn bloom were observed. Organic loading is high, causing near anaerobic conditions upstream in the river Schelde. Because of this there were no important phytoplankton grazers in this part of the estuary and hence the grazing pressure on phytoplankton was minimal. As this reduced losses, biomass is maximal in the river Schelde, despite the very low growth rates. On a number of occasions, primary production by benthic micro-algae on intertidal flats was studied. Comparison of their rates of primary production to phytoplankton production in the same period led to the conclusion that the contribution to total primary production by benthic algae was small. The main reason for this is that the photosynthetic activity declines rapidly after the flats emerged from the water. It is argued that CO2-limitation could only be partially responsible for the noticed decrease in activity. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {This study was carried out to obtain an overview of the main indicator frameworks with their respective types of indicators used or developed for the monitoring of Marine ecosystems in the Netherlands. We identified a total of 199 indicators belonging to 8 frame works and ranked (scored) them using a qualitative analyses based on the “ICES criteria for a good indicators” used for technical evaluation. All identified indicators were related (linked) to all GES qualitative descriptors for determining Good Environmental Status (Annex 1 of the MSFD–Directive 2008/56/EC). Those GES descriptors with a limited number of relevant indicators were identified for further attention (GES descriptors with ‘information gaps'). A maximum of two high ranked indicators of the least covered GES descriptors were identified. All combined this led to a shortlist of 11 indicators that were analysed for their applicability, scientific soundness, practicality and the probable costs involved with future implementation in GES monitoring. All 11 indicators showed to be of high ecological relevance. The establishment of consistent indicator reference target or limit levels seemed intricate mostly due to lack of or insufficient quality of the quantitative basis for setting such levels. Another underlying difficulty is the insufficient understanding of the complex correlations between pressure and impact in time and space. This hampers especially the full implementation and further development of those indicators meant for the monitoring of impacted biota (e.g., benthos, plankton and seals) and may easily lead to a descriptive and costly monitoring that only gradually in time may allow one to correlate system responses to other external events or vice versa and derive cause-effect relationships. The pressure indicators that monitor physical and chemical phenomena scored higher on the technical evaluation, where unambiguous, and reference as well as limit levels may be constructed and set relatively easily. The time frames for implementation and outcome assessment may furthermore be short and costs are relatively low. It is recommended that a balanced set of indicators may be needed for monitoring the GES of the North Sea ecosystem in the context of conservation, protection, and sustainable use. For successful implementation, some indicators of the set should be scientifically specific and designed to further unravel the ecosystem responses to variable human induced impacts, while other indicators, with less explanatory power, will have to monitor anthropogenic drivers and pressures. The set of indicators must be able to address the different objectives set by ecological, social and economic structures.},

Opdrachtgever voor deze grensoverschrijdende evaluatiemethodiek is Vlaams-Nederlandse Schelde Commissie (VNSC), met Rijkswaterstaat-Waterdienst als administratief opdrachtgever. De opdracht werd uitgevoerd door Deltares in samenwerking met de Universiteit Antwerpen. De methodiek is opgebouwd rond de hoofdfuncties uit de langetermijnvisie. Vanuit deze functies is een beperkte set communicatie-indicatoren ontwikkeld. Het eerste hoofdstuk, Inleiding, beschrijft de gebruikte werkwijze en de onderlinge samenhang tussen de communicatie-indicatoren. Elke communicatie-indicator is nadien uitgewerkt als zelfstandig hoofdstuk en kan los van de andere indicatoren gelezen worden.},

Provoost (p.provoost@nioo.knaw.nl) Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 4127 Abstract Recent observations and modelling studies suggest that eutrophication-related biogeo- chemical changes can mask atmospheric CO2-induced pH decreases. Data collected by the Dutch monitoring authorities in different coastal systems (North Sea, Wadden Sea, Ems-Dollard, Eastern Scheldt and Scheldt estuary) since 1975 provide an ex- cellent opportunity to test whether this is the case in the Dutch coastal zone. The time-series were analysed using Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) which resulted in the identification of system-dependent patterns on both seasonal and intra-annual time scales. The observed rates of change greatly exceed those expected from enhanced CO2 uptake, thus confirming that eutrophication can play a dominant role in ocean acidification.},

abstract = {Phaeocystis blooms in the Southern Bight of the North Sea may cause damage to the aquatic ecosystem and to commercial mussel cultures at the entrance of the Oosterschelde estuary. In this paper the potential for early detection of Phaeocystis blooms in Dutch coastal waters is studied, using a combination of field data, satellite observations and hydrodynamic- and biological modelling. For the spring bloom period in the year 2003 MERIS chlorophyll-a maps, derived with the HYDROPT algorithm for coastal waters, were compared to in-situ measurements at stations off the coast in de Voordelta and the results of the GEM biogeochemical model.The analysis shows that the spatial and temporal variability in Phaeocystis abundance and total biomass (expressed by the Chl-a concentration) during spring is large. It is confirmed that blooms may develop off shore and show a tendency to accumulate within 10. km from the coastline, giving rise to rapid biomass accumulation at the mouth of the multiple estuaries in the Voordelta. Based on the outcome of this study an early warning system is proposed that notifies local water managers and shellfish growers for potentially harmful Phaeocystis bloom formation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Los2007,
abstract = {In order to manage aquatic systems, it is necessary to apply methods relating the environmental variables and system-state parameters with external factors that affect the system. External factors can be natural (i.e. the movement of water) or partly-anthropogenic (i.e. nutrient loads). In addition to the national authorities, who have been implementing environmental policies for several decades, the EU is presently implementing the Water Framework Directive (WFD) aimed at establishing a new set of standards for the ecological and water quality of water systems. Among these are the phytoplankton biomass and composition. Phytoplankton affects turbidity, oxygen depletion, total productivity of the system and the occurrence of (harmful) algal blooms. A range of methods is available to relate phytoplankton to the controlling environmental conditions. Among these are statistical relations for instance of the Vollenweider type as well as deterministic simulation models. At the end of the 1970s, a generic deterministic phytoplankton module called BLOOM was developed, which has since been applied to a wide range of fresh water and marine systems. Here we test the applicability of this model as a screening tool for coastal waters. We conclude that the model is able to reproduce observed chlorophyll levels adequately under a wide range of conditions. Subsequently the model is applied to demonstrate the potential impacts of reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus or both nutrients simultaneously. Depending on which factors are initially controlling, the impacts of these reductions vary considerably both between locations and during the season. While this type of application lacks explicit relations between nutrient concentrations and external loadings, it does consider a number of relevant conditions in a consistent way and requires remarkably little data and effort. It is therefore a valuable screening tool. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents the ecological modelling instrument BLOOM/GEM and several applications to the southern North Sea, including a 3-dimensional model validation. The current instrument and its predecessors have been used since the 1980s for evaluating the ecological status of the North Sea and potential effect of management strategies. The main modelled processes of nutrient cycling, oxygen dynamics and primary production are described, as well as the external forcings required for the ecological model (hydrodynamics, suspended sediments and river loads). In the development of the BLOOM/GEM modelling instrument, the explicit choice of processes to include (the 'ecological' resolution) has been balanced with the need for high spatial resolution in the model applications for the Dutch coastal zone. The calibration and validation of the BLOOM/GEM modelling instrument as well as the model applications have mainly drawn on the extensive dataset available for the Dutch coastal waters (http://www.waterbase.nl). A specific 3-dimensional model application to the North Sea is described including the model validation results based on the use of an objective cost function for a number of different substances. Plotted model results showing seasonal as well as regional variations and spatial gradients for many substances at several stations give additional support to the validation. As such, the model is well suited to support many management decisions, related to e.g. the OSPAR convention and the European Water Framework Directive and the construction of infrastructural works. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.
